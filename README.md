<h2>Predicting House Sales</h2>
A basic linear regression model to predict the price a house will sell for. This project was for a competition on Kaggle, a Data Science and Machine Learning platform.
<h2>Titanic Survival Predictions</h2>
As with Predicting House Sales, this project was also for a competition on Kaggle. I used a variety of models with the competition dataset, including K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression, and a Decision Tree model was ultimately the most successful. 
<h2>Battle of The Neighborhoods</h2>
This was my capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera. I used the Foursquare API and a dataset on crime in Atlanta with both unsupervised and supervised classification models to try and predict the level of crime in a neighborhood given the types and frequencies of venues in that neighborhood.
<h2>Algaeorithm</h2>
This was a research project branching off of the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) Ambassador Program. I used image processing tools in python to count Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii algae cells.
